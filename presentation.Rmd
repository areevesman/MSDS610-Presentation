## Introduction

This document will serve as a tutorial for recreating [this](https://areevesman.shinyapps.io/history/) shiny application. The application is a dashboard that allows users to explore Major League Baseball (MLB) data. When a user selects a team, year, and statistic they are interested in, the application renders a plot based on those values. 

We will touch on everything that went into making the app, like scraping the web and using plotly, but the focus will be on building the app itself.

## The Idea

[baseball-reference.com](http://www.baseball-reference.com) is a website that hosts an unimaginable amount of baseball statistics. In particular, it has [these](https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/STL/1960-schedule-scores.shtml) tables that record ceratain aspects of every regular season game for a given team and specific year.

The application will synthesize that data for every current MLB team, for all of the years they have exsited (under that name).

## First Step: Gather the data

Two python scripts (in ipynb format) were created to scrape the data. They utilize the `bs4` (BeautifulSoup) module, which is explained in more detail and used for a similar purpose in this [youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCJ4afDX4L4). They live [here]().

## Define Global Variables and Functions

```{r}
library(shiny)
library(shinythemes)
library(RCurl)
library(plyr)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)

### Functions to interact with github reposity and manipulate data ###

data_folder <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/areevesman/mlb_app_edits/master/data/"


#read in a csv file by name from data_url
#ex: get_table_by_name("STL2006.csv")
get_csv_by_name <- function(name, data_url=data_folder){
  myCSV <- getURL(paste(data_url, name, sep=''))
  myDF <- read.csv(text=myCSV, stringsAsFactors = F) %>% 
    as_tibble()
  return(myDF)
}


#add columns to the original team data from github
#year argument allows a coulmn to be added for year
add_columns <- function(original_team_data, year){
  
  team_data <- original_team_data
  
  team_data$year <- rep(year, times = nrow(original_team_data))
  team_data$games_ahead <- str_replace_all(team_data$games_behind, 'Tied', '0')
  team_data$games_ahead <- gsub(pattern = 'up', replacement = '-', x = team_data$games_ahead)
  team_data$games_ahead <- gsub(pattern = ' ', replacement = '', x = team_data$games_ahead)
  team_data$games_ahead <- -1*as.numeric(team_data$games_ahead)
  team_data$run_diff <- team_data$runs - team_data$runs_allowed
  team_data$r_so_far <- cumsum(team_data$runs)
  team_data$ra_so_far = cumsum(team_data$runs_allowed)
  team_data$rd_so_far = cumsum(team_data$run_diff)
  team_data$wins_so_far = cumsum(!grepl(x = team_data$win_or_loss, pattern='L'))
  team_data$losses_so_far = cumsum(!grepl(x = team_data$win_or_loss, pattern='W'))
  team_data$win_loss_differential = team_data$wins_so_far - team_data$losses_so_far
  team_data$record_so_far =  team_data$wins_so_far / (team_data$wins_so_far + team_data$losses_so_far)
  team_data$who_and_where = ifelse(team_data$home_or_away == "@", 
                                   paste(team_data$team, "@", team_data$opponent),
                                   paste(team_data$opponent, "@", team_data$team))
  team_data$winner = ifelse(team_data$runs > team_data$runs_allowed, 
                            team_data$team,
                            team_data$opponent)

  return(team_data)
}


#get one team's csv's over all years in one csv
combine_years <- function(team, start_year){
  return(get_csv_by_name(paste(team, "_all_years.csv", sep="")))
}



# get teamID data and fix minor data inconsistencies
teamIDs <- get_csv_by_name("teamIDs.csv")
teamIDs[1,] <- c("LAA", "LAA", "Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim", 2005)
teamIDs <- teamIDs[c(2:14,1,15:nrow(teamIDs)),]



### Define Global Variables ###

#all mlb teams (as "STL")
team_choices <- teamIDs$Team_ID
#number of years team has been around
team_num_years <- 2018 - as.integer(teamIDs$First_Year)
#name the vectors with full team names
names(team_choices) <- teamIDs$Full_Team_Name
names(team_num_years) <- teamIDs$Full_Team_Name

#choices of statistics to select
select_stat_choices <- list("Record" = "record_so_far",
                            "Win-Loss Differential" = "win_loss_differential",
                            "Games Ahead/Behind in Division" = "games_ahead",
                            "Cumulative Wins" = "wins_so_far",
                            "Runs" = "runs", 
                            "Runs Allowed" = "runs_allowed",
                            "Run Differential" = "run_diff",
                            "Cumulative Runs" = "r_so_far", 
                            "Cumulative Runs Allowed" = "ra_so_far",
                            "Cumulative Run Differential" = "rd_so_far")




```

## Defining the User-Interface and Server Logic

Adding this code to the user-interface definition will define the layout of the app and create a select box for team. The `uiOutput("team")` will correspond to an `output$team` object in the server logic.

```{r}
  fluidPage(
    
    #select theme
    theme = shinytheme("yeti"),
    
    # select layout 
    verticalLayout(
      
      # create panel with a select box for team
      wellPanel(
        
        #select box for team
        selectInput("select_team", 
                    label = h3("Team"), 
                    choices = team_choices, 
                    selected = team_choices[1]),
        
        #tell server to render more some ui (for slider)
        uiOutput("team")
        
      )
    )
    
  )
```

Adding the following code to the server logic will render make the app render the slider once a team is selected.

```{r}
  #first year in mlb for selected team
  start_year <- reactive({
    as.numeric(teamIDs[which(teamIDs$Team_ID == input$select_team), "First_Year"][[1,1]])
  })
  
  
  #server will render some ui corresponding to "team" (slider box)
  output$team <- renderUI({
    
    sliderInput("slider", 
                label = h3("Year"), 
                min = start_year(), 
                max = 2017, 
                value = start_year(),
                sep = "",
                round = TRUE,
                step = 1,
                animate = animationOptions(interval = 900, 
                                           playButton = "Play Animation"))
  })
```


We can finish the user-interface definition with a select box for the statistic and the `plotlyOutput` call to create a select box for the statistic and to tell the server to create a plot.

```{r}
#select box for statistic
selectInput("select_stat", 
            label = h3("Statistic"),
            choices = select_stat_choices,
            selected = "Runs"),

#will tell server to render plotly object
plotlyOutput("detailed_plot")
```

This code completes the server logic to reder a plot that is specific to the team, year, and statistic of interest.

```{r}
  #get a team's data over all years as a tibble
  team_all_years <- reactive({
    combine_years(input$select_team)
  })
  
  #get limits for plot
  limit_data <- reactive({
    
    stat <- input$select_stat
    #get min and max for stat over all years
    var <- team_all_years()[,c("year", stat)] %>%
      mutate_all(function(col){ 
        col[is.na(col)] <- "0"
        col <- as.numeric(col)
        col}) %>%
      summarise(minimum = min(as.numeric(eval(parse(text = input$select_stat))), na.rm = TRUE),
                maximum = max(as.numeric(eval(parse(text = input$select_stat))), na.rm = TRUE)) 
    
    
    #lower and upper bound for plot y-axis limits
    c(var[[1,"minimum"]], 1.1*var[[1,"maximum"]])
    
  })
  
  
  
  #for plotly
  team_year_data <- reactive({
    get_csv_by_name(paste(input$select_team,
                           input$slider,
                           ".csv",
                           sep="")) %>%
      add_columns(year = input$slider)
  })
  
  
  
  #render the plotly object
  output$detailed_plot <- renderPlotly({
    
    x <- 1:nrow(team_year_data())
    y <- team_year_data()[[input$select_stat]]
    hover <- paste(team_year_data()[["date"]], "\n",
                   team_year_data()[["who_and_where"]], "\n",
                   "Score: ", team_year_data()[["runs"]], "-", team_year_data()[["runs_allowed"]],
                   ", ", team_year_data()[["winner"]], "\n",
                   sep = '')
    
    team_year_data() %>%
      plot_ly(x = ~x,
              y = ~y, 
              hovertext = hover,
              hoverinfo = "text",
              type = 'scatter', 
              mode = 'lines+markers') %>%
      layout(xaxis = list(title = "Game Number in Season"),
             yaxis = list(title = names(select_stat_choices[select_stat_choices==input$select_stat]),
                          range = limit_data()))
    
  })
```
